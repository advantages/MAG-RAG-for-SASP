Begin with a comprehensive description of the system models related to the signal processing issue. Utilize the provided structure `{System Model}` to ensure all relevant information is captured.

### System Model
- **Problem Type:** {Specify the exact type of sensor array signal processing issue at hand. Clearly categorize the problem within the domain of signal processing.}
- **Problem Description:** {Provide a comprehensive description of the signal processing challenge you're addressing. Detail all relevant components that may influence the problem.}
- **System Model Parameters:** {Enumerate all parameters, both qualitative and quantitative, that characterize the system model. This should include mathematical symbols that define the system's behavior and constraints.}
- **System Model Formulations:** {Develop mathematical models that accurately represent the behavior and interactions within the signal system. Formulate equations that express the input-output relationships and any other dynamics pertinent to the system model.}

Once the system model is established, the next step is to precisely define the optimization problem using consistent terminology. Follow the `{Optimization Formulation}` format for clarity.

### Optimization Formulation
- **Optimization Type:** {Identify the class of optimization problem you're tackling. Clearly articulate the methodology that will be used.}
- **Optimization Parameters:** {List the derived parameters from the system model that will inform the optimization process. Include any critical thresholds, limits, or other numerical details that will shape the optimization.}
- **Optimization Variables:** {Pinpoint the decision variables within the optimization process. Clarify the variables that will be manipulated to achieve the optimization objectives.}
- **Objective:** {Craft a clear and concise objective function for the optimization, specifying whether the goal is to maximize or minimize the chosen quantity.}
- **Constraints:** {Compile a comprehensive list of constraints that the optimization variables are bound by. Ensure all physical, technical, and systemic limitations are included.}

The final step is the development of a robust optimization algorithm to resolve the problem as formulated. Document the process using the `{Optimization Algorithm}` format presented below.

### Optimization Algorithm
- **Algorithm Type:** {Select a suitable algorithm type that is most likely to yield an optimal solution for your formulated problem. Justify the selection of the algorithm based on the problem's characteristics.}
- **Algorithm Parameters:** {Detail essential hyperparameters or algorithm configurations that ensure optimal performance. This should cover settings such as learning rates, convergence thresholds, or the number of iterations.}
- **Algorithm Steps:** {Provide a detailed, stepwise algorithm procedure, including precise mathematical formulations at each stage. Explain the initial setup, iterative process, and define the specific criteria for algorithm termination.}

By systematically addressing each stage with the level of detail requested, you will create a well-defined and solvable signal processing problem. This structured approach facilitates a clear understanding and enables a methodical solution to the complex challenges inherent in signal processing.
