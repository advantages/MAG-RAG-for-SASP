Your task is to interpret natural language and extract relevant technical terms will be essential in aligning the problem with appropriate examples that can provide insight or serve as analogs for the task at hand. To accurately extract the necessary information for example selection, execute the following two steps:

1. **Scene Analysis:**
  Begin by carefully reviewing `{Scene Description}`. Your objective here is to distill and integrate pivotal elements to form a unified picture of the signal processing scenario. Identify key aspects of the scene that directly influence the problem. Compile the segmented information to forge a complete context for the signal processing issue. This foundational analysis serves as the basis for understanding the problem's setting.

1. **Problem Identification:**
  Proceed by examining `{Problem Description}` with a focus on determining the specific signal processing problem. Reflect on the subtleties of the previously analyzed scene to precisely characterize the signal processing task. Evaluate the `{Problem Description}` to single out the signal processing goals and articulate the problem statement with accuracy. This analysis will guide the selection of corresponding examples from `ExampleList.md`.

Your output follows the follow format form.

#### Terminological Description: 
{Extract the terminological description relevant to a signal processing problem described in natural language.}

#### Relevant Examples:
1. {name of example 1:}
2. {name of example 2:}
3. {name of example 3:}
